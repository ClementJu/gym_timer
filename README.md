Flutter app - Gym timer and stopwatch with vocal indications, alarm and set counter

If you found the app useful and want to buy me a coffee: https://www.paypal.me/julienclement <br/>Otherwise, just enjoy it! ðŸ˜Š

Thanks to Gym Timer, you can train without looking at your timer every 10 seconds. Main features:

### Timer
 * **Vocal indications** (which can be deactivated) tell you how much time is left before your next set. 
 * At the end, an **alarm** indicates you that the time is up. 
 * A **single beep sound** that is played at a **user-defined frequency** can be set up in addition to the vocal indications.

### Stopwatch
* A **single beep sound** and a **double beep sound** that are played at a **user-defined frequency** can be set up.

### Global
 * Vocal indications, beeps and alarms are hearable **on top of your music**. 
 * Various **progress bars** show you a visual representation of the time remaining until the next beep or alarm.
 * Your **screen does not lock automatically** as long as the timer or the stopwatch is running.
 * The timer and the stopwatch can **run in parallel**. 

The app is composed of three screens: Settings, Timer, Stopwatch.

## Timer

### Timer is not running
One tap on the time increases the counter by the amount of time defined in the settings (step). The time is bound by the interval defined in the settings (range).

A long press on the time allows you to define the duration you want. If you leave the minutes or seconds empty, their value is automatically replaced with "0".

A double tap on the set counter undoes the last action and reverts the list to the previous one. You can then redo your last action if necessary.

The buttons allow to start the timer or reset everything (which clears the set list).

## Settings
Define your own preferences.

You can activate or deactivate vocal indications according to your preferences.

The unilateral mode is to be used when you perform single-arm/leg exercises and rest between each side. The voice tells you which side is next (5 seconds before the end of the rest period).

The "Tap to increase" settings determine how the timer duration increases when taping the timer duration. The range defines the interval, and the step the time increment induced by a tap.
